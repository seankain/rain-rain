This is a godot game about a crosswalk sign come-to-life dodging large raindrops as they fall. It was an idea my son had when I told him that to learn gamedev he should start simple.
I'm taking it as an opportunity to spend more time in the 2D side of Godot as well as seeing if I can get AI to do most of the asset work and programming for prototyping.
